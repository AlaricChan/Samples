## **Continuous Integration vs Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment**

#### **Continuous Integration**

Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid the integration hell that usually happens when people wait for release day to merge their changes into the release branch.

#### **Continuous Delivery**

To make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way.

#### **Continuous Deployment**

Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn't a release day anymore. Developers can focus on building software, and they see their work go live minutes after they've finished working on it.
